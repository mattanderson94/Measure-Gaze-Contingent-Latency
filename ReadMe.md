# A method for estimating closed-loop latency in gaze-contingent rendering experiments

## 📌 Description
This is a method for precisely estimating the closed-loop latency of gaze-contingent rendering. By closed-loop latency, we mean the time between a change in where an observer is looking on a stimulus, and a corresponding update to the stimulus. Various methods exist, but ours has the advantage of requiring no additional hardware beyond what is typically used in eye tracking studies (a monitor and an eye tracker).

Full details are in our paper [here](https://google.com)
